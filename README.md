# HTML Template Description

This HTML template is designed for a product display webpage. It consists of two main sections: left and right.

## Left Section
The left section contains:
- A large heading (`<h1>`) displaying the product name.
- A color selection area (`#color`) showing available colors for the product.
- Product details including a short description (`<p>`).

## Right Section
The right section displays:
- Product price (`<h4>`).
- Product rating (displayed using star icons).
- An image of the product (`<img>`).
- A button styled as a black circle (`#black-circle`) labeled "add to bag".
- The product name displayed at the bottom left corner of the image, rotated at an angle (-90deg).

## Additional Styling
- The overall layout is structured using flexbox (`display: flex`) to ensure responsiveness.
- CSS styles are applied to enhance the visual appearance, including font styling, color schemes, and layout positioning.
